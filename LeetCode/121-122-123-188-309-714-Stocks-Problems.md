# Summary of all stocks problems in LeetCode

## With one transaction

[Problem 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

Use a few variables/dp arrays to represent different states; (there are more efficient ways to solve it using greedy, 
but here let's stick to the more general usage.)

- `dp_0[i]` represents the maximum profit WITHOUT stocks;
- `dp_1[i]` represents the maximum profit with stocks;
- Relations:
  - at `i`th day, the maximum profit without stocks could either be maintained from the previous day, or to be gained by selling the stocks bought the previous day, so $$dp_0[i+1] = max(dp_0[i], dp_1[i] + prices[i])$$;
  - the maximum profit with stocks could be either maintained from the previous day, or to buy stocks; since there is **ONLY ONE CHANCE** to do the transactions, the buying can not be done after selling, so $$dp_1[i+1] = max(dp_1[i], -prices[i])$$; it is ONT $$dp_0[i]-prices[i]$$ because we can only do one transaction, after selling the stock, we can not buy one anymore;
- Bounday conditions: at the begining, we can not have stocks without buying, $$dp_1[0]=INT_MIN$$, while the max profit without having stocks is 0, $$dp_0[0]=0$$;
- The dp array be be reduced to 1D.

```cpp
int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
    int dp_0 = 0; // max profit when there is no stock
    int dp_1 = INT_MIN; // max profit where there is stock
    
    for (int i = 0; i < prices.size(); ++i) {
        dp_0 = max(dp_0, dp_1 + prices[i]);
        dp_1 = max(dp_1, -prices[i]);
    }
    
    return dp_0;
}
```

**Notes**: the max profit for buying stock is $$-prices[i]$$, not $$dp_i_0-prices[i]$$, since we can only do one transaction; 


## With infinite transactions

[Problem 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/)

Similar to the previous case, here since we can do infinite transactions, we can buy new stocks after selling, so the relation becomes $$dp_1[i] = max(dp_1[i], dp_0[i]-prices[i])$$. And we can reduce this to $$O(1)$$ space as well:

```cpp
int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
    int dp_0 = 0; // max profit when there is no stock;
    int dp_1 = INT_MIN; // max profit when there is stock;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < prices.size(); ++i) {
        dp_0 = max(dp_0, dp_1 + prices[i]);
        dp_1 = max(dp_1, dp_0 - prices[i]);
    }
    
    return dp_0;
}
```

> Why dont we use a temp variable to save $$dp_0$$ and use it to update $$dp_1$$?

Not necessary: if $$dp_0$$ is updated with $$dp_1+prices[i]$$, and $$dp_1$$ is taken from $$dp_0 - prices[i]$$, it means there is no buying or selling in that day, the same as no transactions. So we don't have to use an extra variable. But there is also nothing wrong to do so.

## With infinite transactions and transaction fees

[Problem 714. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-transaction-fee/)

Almost the same as the infinite transaction case, except we need to **add the transaction fee every time we sell the stock**;

```cpp
int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices, int fee) {
    if (prices.size() < 2)
        return 0;
    
    int dp_0 = 0; // max profit when there is no stock
    int dp_1 = -prices[0]; // max profit when there is stock
    
    for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); ++i) {
        int dp_0_prev = dp_0;
        dp_0 = max(dp_0, dp_1 + prices[i] - fee);
        dp_1 = max(dp_1, dp_0_prev - prices[i]);
    }
    
    return dp_0;
}
```

The transaction fee can also be **added to the time we buy stocks**:

```cpp
int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices, int fee) {
    if (prices.size() < 2)
        return 0;
    
    int dp_0 = 0; // max profit when there is no stock
    int dp_1 = -prices[0] - fee; // max profit when there is stock
    
    for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); ++i) {
        int dp_0_prev = dp_0;
        dp_0 = max(dp_0, dp_1 + prices[i]);
        dp_1 = max(dp_1, dp_0_prev - prices[i] - fee);
    }
    
    return dp_0;
}
```

## With Cooldown

[Problem 309. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-cooldown/)

The cooldown day is added, so we have one more state: the cooldown state $$dp_2$$; we can not buy new stocks when selling stocks in the previous day, so $$dp_0$$ can not go to $$dp_1$$ directly, instead, $$dp_0$$ will go to $$dp_2$$, and $$dp_1$$ will come from $$dp_2$$;

```cpp
int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
    int dp_0 = 0; // max profit when there is no stock
    int dp_1 = INT_MIN; // max profit when there is stock
    int dp_2 = 0; // max profit when there is no stock and we can buy new stock
    
    for (int i = 0; i < prices.size(); ++i) {
        int dp_0_prev = dp_0;
        int dp_1_prev = dp_1;
        int dp_2_prev = dp_2;

        dp_0 = max(dp_0_prev, dp_1_prev + prices[i]);
        dp_1 = max(dp_1_prev, dp_2_prev - prices[i]);
        dp_2 = max(dp_2_prev, dp_0_prev);
    }
    
    return max(dp_0, dp_2);
}
```

## With maximum 2 transactions

[Problem 123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii/)

The problem requires us to do at most 2 transactions: so we have five states:
- $$dp_0$$: no transactions at all; $$dp_0$$ will always be 0, since there is no transaction at all;
- $$dp_1$$: after one buying; $$dp_1 = max(dp_1, -prices[i])$$;
- $$dp_2$$: after one selling; $$dp_2 = max(dp_2, dp_1 + prices[i])$$;
- $$dp_3$$: after 2nd buying; $$dp_3 = max(dp_3, dp_2 - prices[i])$$;
- $$dp_4$$: after 2nd selling; $$dp_4 = max(dp_4, dp_3 + prices[i])$$;

And for the bounday conditions:
- $$dp_0=0$$; 
- $$dp_2=INT_MIN; dp_4=INT_MIN$$; since we can not sell stocks before buying;
- $$dp_1=0, dp_3=0$$, the minimum profit should be zero;

```cpp
int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
    int dp_1 = INT_MIN; // max profit after first time holding stocks
    int dp_2 = 0; // max profit after first selling
    int dp_3 = INT_MIN; // max profit after second buying
    int dp_4 = 0; // max profit after second selling
    
    for (int price: prices) {
        int dp_1_pre = dp_1;
        int dp_2_pre = dp_2;
        int dp_3_pre = dp_3;
        int dp_4_pre = dp_4;
        
        dp_1 = max(dp_1_pre, -price);
        dp_2 = max(dp_2_pre, dp_1_pre + price);
        dp_3 = max(dp_3_pre, dp_2_pre - price);
        dp_4 = max(dp_4_pre, dp_3_pre + price);
    }
    
    return max(dp_2, dp_4);
}
```

## With maximum k transactions

[Problem 188. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iv/)

Here the maximum number of transactions have been generalized from 2 to k; so we need a DP array to store the $$2*k$$ states;

- $$dp_0[ik]$$ represents the maximum profit after maximum ik transactions, without stocks in hand;
- $$dp_1[ik]$$ represents the maximum profit after maximum ik transactions, with stocks in hand;
- if $$ik!=0$$, $$dp_1[ik] = max(dp_1[ik], dp_0[ik-1] - prices[i])$$; if $$ik==0$$, $$dp_1[ik] = max(dp_1[ik], -prices[i])$$;
- $$dp_0[ik] = max(dp_0[ik], dp_1[ik]+prices[i])$$
- Boundary conditions are $$dp_0$$ is 0 at the beginng, no profit; $$dp_1$$ is INT_MIN, since it is not possible to own stocks without any transaction

We also notice that if $$k>N/2$$, then the problem equals to we can make infinite transactions;

```cpp
int maxProfit(int k, vector<int>& prices) {
    int N = prices.size();
    if (N < 2 || k < 1)
        return 0;
    
    if (k > N/2)
        // this goes back to the infinity transactions problem
        return maxProfit_InfTransaction(prices);
    
    vector<int> dp_0(k, 0);
    // dp_0[k]: max profit without stocks with k trade
    vector<int> dp_1(k, INT_MIN);
    // dp_1[k]: max profit with stocks with k trade
    
    for (int price: prices) {
        for (int ki = 0; ki < k; ++ki) {
            dp_0[ki] = max(dp_0[ki], dp_1[ki] + price);
            if (ki == 0)
                dp_1[ki] = max(dp_1[ki], -price);
            else
                dp_1[ki] = max(dp_1[ki], dp_0[ki - 1] - price);
        }
    }
    
    return dp_0[k - 1];
    
}

int maxProfit_InfTransaction(const vector<int>& prices){
    int N = prices.size();
    
    // calculate the max profit with infinity transactions
    int dp_0 = 0; // max profit without stocks
    int dp_1 = INT_MIN; // max profit with stocks
    
    for (int price: prices) {
        dp_0 = max(dp_0, dp_1 + price);
        dp_1 = max(dp_1, dp_0 - price);
    }
    
    return dp_0;
}
```
