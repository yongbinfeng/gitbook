## DFS Solution

Almost standard DFS/Backtracking problem. Some small differences:
- The robot can only start from `(0,0)`; so dfs only needs to start from `(0,0)`;
- The problem is counting how many cells the robot could reach. Starting from `(0,0)`, the robot actually only needs to move to right or bottom, no need to go up or to the left;

```cpp
int movingCount(int m, int n, int k) {
    vector<vector<bool>> visited(m, vector<bool>(n, 0));
    return dfs(visited, 0, 0, m, n, k);
}

int dfs(vector<vector<bool>>& visited, int i, int j, int m, int n, int k) {
    if (i >= m || j >= n || visited[i][j] ||calcSum(i, j) > k) 
        // out of the boundary
        return 0;
        
    visited[i][j] = true;
    int count = dfs(visited, i + 1, j, m, n, k) + dfs(visited, i, j + 1, m, n, k) + 1;
    return count;
}

// calculate the sum of all digits of i and j
int calcSum(int i, int j) {
    int sum = 0;
    while (i > 0) {
        sum += i % 10;
        i = i / 10;
    }
    while (j > 0) {
        sum += j % 10;
        j = j / 10;
    }
    return sum;
}
```

Time complexity is $$O(MN)$$: in the worse case, DFS could travel through all the cells; Space complexity is also $$O(MN)$$.

## BFS Solution

We can also use the BFS to solve this problem, using `queue`. Here we just need to count how many cells, no need to count how many steps it need to reach the cell, so the extra loop to count the layers/steps in BFS is not needed anymore.

```cpp
int movingCount(int m, int n, int k) {
    vector<vector<bool>> visited(m, vector<bool>(n, 0));
    const vector<vector<int>> moves = {{1, 0}, {0, 1}};

    int count = 1;
    queue<vector<int>> q;
    q.push(vector<int>{0, 0});
    while (!q.empty()) {
        vector<int> point = q.front();
        q.pop();
        for (auto move: moves) {
            int x = point[0] + move[0];
            int y = point[1] + move[1];
            if ( x < m && y < n && !visited[x][y] && calcSum(x, y) <= k) {
                visited[x][y] = true;
                ++count;
                q.push({x, y});
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}

// calculate the sum of all digits of i and j
int calcSum(int i, int j) {
    int sum = 0;
    while (i > 0) {
        sum += i % 10;
        i = i / 10;
    }
    while (j > 0) {
        sum += j % 10;
        j = j / 10;
    }
    return sum;
}
```

Time complexity is $$O(MN)$$. Space complexity is $$O(MN)$$. The actual running time is larger than DFS, which i think is because of the lots of contructions of the coordinate vectors.
