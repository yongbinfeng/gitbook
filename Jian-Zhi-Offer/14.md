# 14- I. 剪绳子

[Problem](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/jian-sheng-zi-lcof/)

This is the same problem as [Problem 343](../LeetCode/343-Integer-Break.md). It can be solved with DP, or the greedy with some math.

# II. 剪绳子 II

[Problem](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/jian-sheng-zi-ii-lcof/)

Now `n` is big enough and we have to take the remainder, the DP solution will not work anymore. We have to take the greedy approach.

```cpp
int cuttingRope(int n) {
    if (n == 2)
        return 1;
    if (n == 3)
        return 2;
    int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
    unsigned result = 1;
    while (n > 4) {
        n = n - 3;
        result = (result * 3) % MOD;
    }
    result = (result * n) % MOD;
    return result;
}
```
