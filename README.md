# Algorithms

## Miscellaneous

GitBook: [https://yongbinfeng.gitbook.io/algorithms/](https://yongbinfeng.gitbook.io/algorithms/)

These are some notes i am making while learning algorithms and working on leetcode problems.
i realized it might help other people a bit, so i made it public, though i understand 
there are already all kinds of leetcode solutions and summaries. 

In each page, i put the main points and thoughts there, with the original and optimized code. At the bottom, 
there are some highlighted **notes** where it is easy for me making mistakes.

My goal is to have about $$O(100)$$ problems here, covering aspects of different types ususally examined during interview.

Issues and PRs are of course more than welcome :)

## Short Names:

Summary of some short names used in contents

* DW: Distinct ways: $$dp[i]=dp[path1]+dp[path2]+...+dp[pathn]$$ 
* FSP: Finite state problems
* LIS: Longest increasing subsequence
* MPRT: Maximum/Minimum paths to reach a target: $$dp[i]=max(dp[path1\_to\_i], dp[path2\_to\_i], ..., dp[pathn\_to\_i])$$
